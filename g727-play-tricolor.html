I don't want to be involved with this game anymore. Guess i'll go in detail with a handful of reasons why I'm doing so and, perhaps, reasons why you should consider it as well #1) Alliance War I don't see why would.

I have a few legendaries that I was planning on adding to it to make it complete, but now I‚Äôm wondering with what seems like the future leaning to 3 color decks if I should craft the last missing ‚Äúingredients‚Äù for this deck. I guess the reality is the legendaries I plan on crafting are good all around cards I could see going into multiple decks, I‚Äôm just stingy with my gems and want to make them count. –¢—Ä–∏–∫–æ–ª–æ—Ä ‚Äî –∫—Ä—É–ø–Ω–µ–π—à–∏–π —Ä–æ—Å—Å–∏–π—Å–∫–∏–π –æ–ø–µ—Ä–∞—Ç–æ—Ä —Ü–∏—Ñ—Ä–æ–≤–æ–≥–æ —Ç–µ–ª–µ–≤–∏–¥–µ–Ω–∏—è: —Ç–µ–ª–µ–≤–∏–¥–µ–Ω–∏–µ –≤—ã—Å–æ–∫–æ–π —á–µ—Ç–∫–æ—Å—Ç–∏, —Å–ø—É—Ç–Ω–∏–∫–æ–≤—ã–π –ò–Ω—Ç–µ—Ä–Ω–µ—Ç, –æ–ø–ª–∞—Ç–∞, –ø–æ–¥–¥–µ—Ä–∂–∫–∞, –∞–∫—Ü–∏–∏. This was Hearthstones reasoning for removing two very powerful cards from the game, that enabled cool new archetypes, but ended up significantly homogenezing the metagame and reducing the viability of many other archetypes and playstyles. Genn and Baku (the offenders in question) imposed an at first sight very significant deckbuilding restriction on the player. If the player held himself to those limitations, he would be rewarded with a very strong passive advantage. In the case of Hearthstone.

We know this is an issue now. Between Tribunal and Telvanni grinding out attrition based games, its really killing the fun. amp#x200B; But consider the cards we have seen so far from Alliance War.

OK everyone, it's official that we are getting the other 5 Tri-colors now, the sky will fall, the game will die, and consequences will never be the same etc etc. But it's happening. What are your thoughts? Excited? Willing to quit the game over it? I personally am not surprised in the slightest, I felt they would release the rest of the tri-colors the moment they released the first set a year ago.

Good day Cubers! Welcome to Terrible Card Tuesday! This is a weekly post where we talk about cards we have either cut from our Cubes or are curious about why they are run in other Cubes when they seem lacking. Did you recently cut an under-performing card from your Cube? Do you spot a card in other peoples lists that you believe to be absolute trash? Is making fun of Psychatog the only thing that gives you pleasure?

Why? 1. Community Concensus appears to be that Houses are fun, but almost strictly better. 2. Numerous competitive players like Ianbits and Warriors7 have discussed that House decks are harder to read, harder to mulligan for, and tend to be more similar to each other, making the game less skill-based and interesting. 3. If Houses are already a concern, and their rotation is at the very least 6-12 months away, it seems fair to inform the community. 4. Recent tournaments like Warpmeta –°–ø—É—Ç–Ω–∏–∫–æ–≤–æ–µ —Ç–µ–ª–µ–≤–∏–¥–µ–Ω–∏–µ –¢—Ä–∏–∫–æ–ª–æ—Ä –ú–æ—Å–∫–≤–∞. –£—Å—Ç–∞–Ω–æ–≤–∫–∞/–Ω–∞—Å—Ç—Ä–æ–π–∫–∞/–ø–æ–¥–∫–ª—é—á–µ–Ω–∏–µ –æ–±–æ—Ä—É–¥–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏—è.  –ø—Ä–∏–ª–æ–∂–µ–Ω–∏–µ ¬´Play.–¢—Ä–∏–∫–æ–ª–æ—Ä¬ª. For those of us who are not fans of Houses tell us what you think of the new expansion. If you have issues with the announced Roadmap let us know your concerns. Simply put, I hated the Houses from the start. 75 card decks with a 3 card starting hand makes for ridiculous RNG draw swings. On top of that the ability to play powerful class cards made our current Houses mostly "good stuff" collections of 3 colours plus Class cards. I don't want to play Houses. I don't want inconsistencies. –¢–µ–ø–µ—Ä—å ¬´–¢—Ä–∏–∫–æ–ª–æ—Ä –¢–í¬ª –º–æ–∂–Ω–æ —Å–º–æ—Ç—Ä–µ—Ç—å –∏ —á–µ—Ä–µ–∑ –∏–Ω—Ç–µ—Ä–Ω–µ—Ç! –ü—Ä–æ—Å—Ç–æ –ø–æ–¥–∫–ª—é—á–∏—Ç–µ —Å–≤–æ–π –ø—Ä–∏—ë–º–Ω–∏–∫ –º–æ–¥–µ–ª–∏ gs –ê–°790 –∫ –∏–Ω—Ç–µ—Ä–Ω–µ—Ç—É –∏ –ø–æ–ª—É—á–∏—Ç–µ —Å–≤–æ–±–æ–¥—É –æ—Ç —Ä–∞—Å–ø–∏—Å–∞–Ω–∏—è:. Dual-color cards are stronger than standard cards. This makes sense, because they‚Äôre more exclusive, and there‚Äôs less of them. They help enable archetypes within their classes and it‚Äôs perfectly acceptable for a deck to have a few cards that are stronger than the others. However, the power of dual-color cards is blown out of proportions in tri-color decks. Each house can run 3 different classes of dual-color cards, which means they can run three times as many of these extra powerful cards, while. –ü—Ä–∏–ª–æ–∂–µ–Ω–∏–µ Play –¢—Ä–∏–∫–æ–ª–æ—Ä –º–æ–∂–µ—Ç –∫–æ–º—É –∏ –ø–æ–Ω—Ä–∞–≤–∏—Ç—Å—è –Ω–æ –æ–±–º–µ–Ω —Å–≤–æ–µ–≥–æ( —Å—Ç–∞—Ä–æ–≥–æ) —Ä–µ—Å–∏–≤–µ—Ä–∞ –Ω–∞ –ø—Ä–µ–¥–ª–∞–≥–∞–µ–º—ã–π —Å –¥–æ–ø–ª–∞—Ç–æ–π –º–Ω–µ –Ω–µ –ø–æ –¥—É—à–µ. I see the telvanni decks on the ladder, where almost every card synergizes well with another in the deck, and I feel that so many other decks are now lacking the ability to keep up. Namely Sorcerer, spellsword, monk, scout, and mage. Battlemage and warrior seem to still be effective because of a few extremely powerful cards within those classes, and the Charge dynamic. One solution I thought of is that perhaps they could make some 2 color exclusive cards.

I wouldn't call this a rant - more like an abstract thought. What's the deal with tricolors? amp#x200B; Tricolors are a very interesting aspect of this game. On one hand, tThey allow for a lot of deckbuilding creativity and give the builder a lot more tools to overcome the challenges associated with deckbuilding. On the other, tricolors are usually, if not always, an objectively better version of their two color parts. Want to play archer? Why not just play Hlaalu? Mid Sorc?
